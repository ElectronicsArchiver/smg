# Super Mario Galaxy 1

This repo contains a WIP decompilation of Super Mario Galaxy 1 (US).

It builds the following DOL:

main.dol: `sha1: 9A71008AE1EE9010E267FA67D1F0B0D4F0E895DD`

## Build Instructions

1. Obtain a clean DOL of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and place it in the include folder and name it `baserom.dol`.
2. Obtain a copy of mwcceppc and mwldeppc from CodeWarrior (I can supply this if you DM me) These are also available [here](https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/devsuites/PowerPC/CW55xx_v2_10_SE.exe). You can run the installer and grab the two files out of the `PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tools` folder where you installed it. Also obtain powerpc-eabi-as and powerpc-eabi-objcopy. These will go into the `tools` folder.
3. Build tools and `make`.
